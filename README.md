# Flashbots Research

Flashbots is a research and development organization focused on the impact MEV has on state-rich blockchains such as Ethereum. MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) is a multidisciplinary topic and our research explores MEV market dynamics and blockchain design challenges at the intersection of economics, security, and cryptography. Our research and development operate hand in hand and have been designed to closely feed into each-other, forming a dual engine that propels Flashbots forward. In line with our organization's values, all our research efforts are open to the public and highly collaborative. You can see more about Flashbots [here](https://www.flashbots.net/).

We are building Flashbots Research as a research hub for MEV, tackling and uncovering questions relevant to the short, medium and long-term future of the ecosystem. We aim to build a sustainable research organization, where ambitious researchers can focus on the most interesting research problems, unencumbered by the friction of academia and the shackles of the industries.

## Research Topics
Our research covers a wide array of topics centered around the MEV theme. Several of these topics are directly related to our auction system and are meant as initial explorations around problems that will eventually need to be solved for our project to ultimately succeed. Other topics are more loosely related, and are part of our wider effort to illuminate the MEV landscape to level the playing field for all actors involved.

You can read some of the research we've released on [Flashbots Writings](https://writings.flashbots.net/research) and the [Flashbots Forum](https://collective.flashbots.net/c/research/20).

## Flashbots Research Proposals
To fuel the collaborative nature of our research, we have a process in place for Flashbots Research Proposal (FRPs), where anybody can submit a research proposal for consideration. Upon community review, proposals will be considered for becoming part of our research, and might become eligible for a grant.

Find out more about our research [process](process.md), ongoing [FRPs](FRPs/) and the [grants](grants.md) we issue. You can see more about past FRPs in the [FRP section of the Flashbots Forum](https://collective.flashbots.net/c/frp/24).
