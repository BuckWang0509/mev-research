**We will update this topics list in May 2025.** 
In the interim, we are happy to review submitted proposals for FRP support of projects making empirical, theory, or implementation contributions to illumating MEV for Ethereum and L2 blockchains. You can gain a sense of our current areas of focus by looking through the active FRP folder [here](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-research/tree/main/FRPs/active) or the Research section of the Flashbots Forum [here](https://collective.flashbots.net/c/research/20).
